# Introduction

**MARS** is shortened for **Multi-Agent Research Studio**, a library for mulit-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) research. A lot of recent progress has been made in various settings of MARL, including two-player zero-sum games, like Go, Chess, StarCraft, as well as n-player general-sum games, like Capture the Flag, Dota. 

Different objectives can be selected in a MARL game, like Nash equilibrium, correlated equilibrium, coarse correlated equilibrium, etc, to reach a goal either as a stable point in payoff function or maximum of social welfare.  

>*-If life exists on Mars, shall we human cooperate or compete with it?*

MARS uses PyTorch for most of its implementation, supporting multi-agent cooperative, competitive and mixed type games.
